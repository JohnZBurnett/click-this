Click This is a browser-based JavaScript game which tests the user's ability to click quickly and accurately. The user must click targets as they appear. Each successful click awards one point. 

### HOW TO PLAY ###
Enter a username, and select a grid size. Larger grids will result in smaller targets, and thus a higher level of difficulty. 

In "Lives Mode", the player has three lives, and will lose one life for each missed click. Once all lives have been lost, the game is over. 

In "Time Trial Mode", the user has 15 seconds to click as many target as possible. Missed clicks subtract one second from the timer, while successful clicks add .5.
